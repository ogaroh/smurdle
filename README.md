# SMURDLE

Smurdle is a simple yet addictive word puzzle game. In Smurdle, players have six chances to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback by indicating which letters in the guessed word are correct and in the right position (marked with green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (marked with yellow), and which letters are not in the word at all (marked with gray). The goal is to deduce the secret word using these clues within the given number of attempts. It's a fun and challenging game that exercises your vocabulary and deductive reasoning skills.
